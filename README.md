Repository for project 5

Tapping into community-lead software projects

Clients:  Rebecca Vivian and Brad Alexander

Finding interesting projects from across a range of diverse fields are so valuable for providing CS students with
relevant, real-world projects to work on and the experience of working with "clients". However, finding ways
to efficiently curate, organise and share project ideas within and across faculties is becoming more challenging
as the number of students enrolling in CS courses are growing each year, as are the programs on offer.
There are multiple programs across CS that require real projects, with students who have varying interests,
skills and course requirements. In this project you will work with academics at the School of CS to develop an
online site that allows university staff to look for examples, submit Expression of Interest, be guided to identify
user requirements and receive feedback on their requests.
